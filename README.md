Here you can find all the Arduino Sketches programmed by me for the IKTAN Roving's telemetry system.

• All the sensors utilised for the telemetry system were programmed in Arduino and finally put together in one single file for specific reasons.

• The Arduino Sketch employed for the solar box circuit is uploaded separately.
